# SVD

Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a linear algebra technique where a matrix is factored into product of three matrices A = UÎ£VT. For further information refer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition
One application of SVD is data compression. Given a data matrix A (for instance an image), SVD can help to find a low rank matrix which is a good approximation of the original data matrix.in app
In this project I have created a very basic image compression algorithm. Given a colored image, the algorithm will calculate the singular value decomposition of the image matrix. Then it will find the optimal number of dimensions required to get best tradeoff between reconstruction error and image fidelity. As a quality measure, I have used Frobenius Norm to calculate the reconstruction error.
